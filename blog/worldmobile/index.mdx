#### Over half of the world is unconnected

According to the statistics, 1.7 billion people are unbanked. Based on the new data from ***<em>[Itu](https://www.itu.int/hub/2021/11/facts-and-figures-2021-2-9-billion-people-still-offline/)</em>*** almost 3 billion
people have never connected to the internet in their whole life. Even though there are more than thousands of 
mobile network operators, none of them try to connect the unconnected due to high cost of infrastructure and 
no financial incentives for investment in remote areas.

If you are interested in real world use case projects, you may come across with World Mobile. Undoubtedly, 
World Mobile is one of the most promising project on Cardano blockchain. IOHK - Cardano has invested 10% stake in this enterprise.

#### What is World Mobile?

World Mobile is founded by Micky Watkins in London 2018. It’s the first global network which built on Cardano blockchain 
technology. Based on their shared economy model, they would like to create a network to delivering connectivity in remote 
areas around the Africa and beyond with cheaper and more efficient than ever.

#### Innovative - Low cost internet solution

World mobile is following a different approach which is based on shared economy model that enable lower operational cost
and more efficient way to connect the unconnected. In Tanzania, 20% of population has access to the internet, according to the World Bank.
After 3 years of feasibility study, World Mobile started to roll out the network in an isolated fishing village in Tanzania. 
Team share the ownership of the global network with local business owners and share the rewards for long term sustainability. 
The team make it possible for locals to host an air node which is a simple pole that has a solar panel on top it and underneath 
of the pole, it has a wireless access point, plugged into the world mobile chain with the raspberry pi. Each air node provides 
connectivity to 500 - 700 people. That system cost less than 5000$ and enable street light, connectivity and provide digital 
identity to the locals. Here is a video from World mobile team.

Villagers who run these air nodes maintain these infrastructure and can earn crypto rewards. In addition, any generated electricity 
can also be sold at the same time. Basically, these air nodes provide really affordable internet to locals and generate revenues. 
Put in simply, it pay itself.

#### Internet coverage with balloons

World mobile team is launching a hybrid network which use balloons that will provide internet coverage across the Tanzanian islands.
This solar-powered filled with helium will float 300 meters above land and have a broadcast range of around 70 km a piece,
using 3g and 4g frequencies to deliver the signal.  These balloons can stay airborne for up to 14 days before descending refilling.
World Mobile`s first ballon will launch in June 2022.

According to Micky Watkins, current local users spend approximately 4$ a month on internet usage . Users can onboard with their cash or 
buy the WMT token to connect the internet. Teams goal is making internet available to entire population in Zanzibar by the end of 2023 
and then Tanzania in a few years. Afterwards, Kenya and other African nations be on their radar. The sharing economy will not stop until 
they delivering connectivity all around Africa.
