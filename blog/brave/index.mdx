#### Why I chose Brave browser over Google Chrome?

The most popular browsers Chrome and others keep your data in their servers and can access
 the data easily. Basically, Google access your data and your personal information is up for 
 sale to highest bidder and you will get nothing in return. On the other hand, Brave browser 
 doesn’t collect any personal information from users and information is stored on your device. 
 In addition, Brave pay users for viewing unanimously match ad inside the browser. 

#### What is Brave Browser? 

Brave is privacy first ad blocking browser. It’s free and open-source browser that built on 
Chromium. Brave Software is founded by Brendan Eich, the creator of Javascript programming 
language. Currently, more than 50 million people are using Brave browser for a faster and safer web.
